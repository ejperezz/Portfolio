        <p> When I was younger, I loved being around technology. I was always fasinated how technology worked. The ideas were endless when it cAme to technology. As i got older and i learned more and more about technology, I decided Computer Science was my best path. I was undecided on the area of computer science i wanted to focus on. Something about the world of frontend intrested me and decided to go with it. I loved working with the front end development because of the ability to design anything from scratch.</p>
